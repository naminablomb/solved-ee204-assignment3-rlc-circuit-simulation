 <li>A voltage step input is given to the following circuits. Find out the expression for current as a function of time and plot the expression. Label the important features of the graph. You can use Laplace</li>

 <li>An ac signal <em>v<sub>i</sub>(t) </em>= sin(2π10<sup>5</sup>t+π/2) is given as an input for the above circuits instead of the step input. Find out the expression for the ac current flowing through each of the circuits.</li>

 <li>Find out the expression for impedance as a function of frequency for all the above circuits. Plot the magnitude and phase of the impedance as a function of frequency for all of them. Consider two cases a) frequency in linear scale and b) frequency in log scale.</li>

 <li>Simulate the curves in SPICE and check your results.</li>
